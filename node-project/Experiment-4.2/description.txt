Title: REST API for Playing Card Collection Using Express.js

Description:
This project involves the development of a RESTful API using Express.js, a widely used web framework for Node.js, to manage a collection of playing cards. The main objective is to provide a clear understanding of backend development, including routing, handling HTTP requests, data management, and following REST architectural principles. The API is designed to perform essential CRUD operations on a playing card collection stored in an in-memory array, which ensures simplicity while focusing on the core concepts of server-side programming.

The API implements the following key functionalities:
Retrieve All Cards (GET /cards) – This endpoint returns the complete collection of playing cards in JSON format, allowing users or client applications to view all available cards at a glance. It demonstrates how to structure server responses for data retrieval operations efficiently.
Retrieve a Specific Card by ID (GET /cards/:id) – Users can fetch details of a single card by its unique identifier. The API validates the ID and responds with the relevant card information if it exists, or a 404 Not Found message if it does not, illustrating proper error handling and response status management.
Add a New Card (POST /cards) – This endpoint allows the addition of a new card to the collection by providing the card's suit and value in the request body. Input validation ensures that only complete and valid card data is accepted, demonstrating data integrity practices and server-side validation techniques. The newly added card is assigned a unique ID automatically, showcasing dynamic data handling.
Delete a Card by ID (DELETE /cards/:id) – This endpoint enables the removal of a card using its unique ID. It checks if the card exists and deletes it from the in-memory array, returning a confirmation message along with the deleted card data. If the card does not exist, it provides a proper error response, reinforcing the importance of robust error management in APIs.

The project emphasizes the following core concepts of backend development:
RESTful API Design: Following REST principles ensures clarity in routing, proper use of HTTP methods, and predictable interactions for client applications.
Data Handling in Memory: Using an in-memory array to store cards highlights how data can be manipulated, added, retrieved, and deleted without a database, making the API lightweight and fast for testing purposes.
JSON Responses & HTTP Status Codes: All endpoints return data in JSON format, and meaningful HTTP status codes are used for success, creation, and error states.
Input Validation & Error Handling: Ensures reliability and robustness by validating inputs and handling edge cases, such as invalid IDs or missing data fields.
Scalability & Extensibility: While currently using in-memory storage, the API structure allows easy extension to connect with databases such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL, demonstrating real-world adaptability.
This project serves as a practical demonstration of building a complete backend service, handling different types of HTTP requests, and managing data operations in a structured way. It showcases a clear understanding of server-client interactions, Node.js runtime, and Express.js capabilities, making it an effective exercise for anyone learning modern backend development.

Technical Highlights & Best Practices:
RESTful Architecture:
The API strictly follows REST principles, using appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) and stateless communication, ensuring predictable behavior and ease of integration with client-side applications.

JSON-Based Responses:
All endpoints respond in JSON format, making the API compatible with web clients, mobile apps, and third-party integrations.

Error Handling & Validation:
Proper error handling is implemented to manage invalid requests, missing data fields, or non-existent resources, highlighting professional-grade API design.

In-Memory Data Management:
Using an in-memory array simplifies development while providing a clear understanding of data storage, retrieval, and manipulation, and sets the foundation for future database integration.

Scalability & Extensibility:
The architecture is modular, allowing easy extension to connect with databases like MongoDB or PostgreSQL, add middleware for authentication, or integrate with logging and monitoring tools.

Asynchronous Handling:
Although simple in-memory storage is synchronous, the project is structured to support asynchronous operations, preparing it for real-world scenarios involving I/O-bound tasks like database queries or external API calls.

Maintainability:
The code is structured for readability and maintainability, demonstrating clear routing, separation of concerns, and consistent coding practices, which are critical in professional backend development.

Learning Outcomes:
By completing this project, students gain:
Hands-on experience with Express.js and Node.js for backend development.
Understanding of RESTful API design, including routing, HTTP methods, and status codes.
Skills in data handling and validation, with real-world scenarios of adding, retrieving, and deleting resources.
Knowledge of error handling, JSON responses, and client-server interactions.
Foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready APIs with modular architecture.

Overall, this project provides a complete end-to-end demonstration of building a backend system, from designing routes and handling HTTP requests to managing data and ensuring proper response handling. It not only reinforces fundamental backend development skills but also introduces advanced concepts like scalability, extensibility, and professional coding practices, making it a highly valuable learning exercise and an exemplary submission for academic evaluation.
Overall, this REST API provides a fully functional and extensible solution for managing a playing card collection, combining best practices in web development with hands-on experience in API design, making it an ideal project for academic evaluation and practical learning.
